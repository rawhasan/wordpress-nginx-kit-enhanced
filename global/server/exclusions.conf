# ================================================================
# üîí NGINX EXCLUSIONS CONFIG FOR WORDPRESS
# 
# This configuration is designed to enhance the security of a 
# WordPress site by denying access to sensitive files, extensions, 
# and directories that should never be publicly exposed.
# 
# ‚úî Blocks access to:
#   - Hidden files like .htaccess, .DS_Store
#   - Sensitive file types (.ini, .log, .conf)
#   - PHP files inside uploads (to prevent RCE)
#   - Internal-only folders (logs, backups, cache, shells, migrate)
# 
# Suitable for inclusion in your main nginx.conf or vhost configs.
# ================================================================

# Deny all attempts to access hidden files such as .htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store (Mac).
# Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
location ~* /\.(?!well-known/) {
    deny all;
}

# Prevent access to certain file extensions
location ~* \.(ini|log|conf)$ {
    deny all;
}

# Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the uploads directory
# Works in sub-directory installs and also in multisite network
# Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
location ~* /(uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
}

# üîê Deny web access to sensitive internal directories
location ~* ^/(logs|backups|cache|migrate|shells)/ {
    deny all;
}
